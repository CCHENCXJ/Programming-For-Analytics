## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Factor in R

Factors are variables in R which take on a limited number of different values; such variables are often referred to as categorical variables.

In a dataset, we can distinguish two types of variables: categorical and continuous.

In a categorical variable, the value is limited and usually based on a particular finite group. For example, a categorical variable can be countries, year, gender, occupation.
A continuous variable, however, can take any values, from integer to decimal. For example, we can have the revenue, price of a share, etc..





factor(x = character(), levels, labels = levels, ordered = is.ordered(x))
Arguments:<br /> 
- x: A vector of data. Need to be a string or integer, not decimal.<br /> 
- Levels: A vector of possible values taken by x. This argument is optional. The default value is the unique list of items of the vector x.<br /> 
- Labels: Add a label to the x data. For example, 1 can take the label `male` while 0, the label `female`. <br /> 
- ordered: Determine if the levels should be ordered.

```{r}
# Create gender vector
gender_vector <- c("Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male")
class(gender_vector)
# Convert gender_vector to a factor
factor_gender_vector <-factor(gender_vector)
class(factor_gender_vector)
```

## Nominal Categorical Value 
Order does not matter

```{r}
# Create a color vector
color_vector <- c('blue', 'red', 'green', 'white', 'black', 'yellow')
# Convert the vector to factor
factor_color <- factor(color_vector)
factor_color
```
## Ordinal categorical variable
Ordinal categorical variable does have a natural ordering. We can specify the order, from the lowest to the highest with order = TRUE and highest to lowest with order = FALSE.
```{r}
day_vector <- c('evening', 'morning', 'afternoon', 'midday', 'midnight', 'evening')
# Convert `day_vector` to a factor with ordered level
factor_day <- factor(day_vector, order = TRUE, levels =c('morning', 'midday', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'midnight'))
# Print the new variable
factor_day
```
```{r}
## Levels: morning < midday < afternoon < evening < midnight
# Append the line to above code
# Count the number of occurence of each level
summary(factor_day)
```
## Continuous variables
Continuous class variables are the default value in R. They are stored as numeric or integer. We can see it from the dataset below. mtcars is a built-in dataset. It gathers information on different types of car. We can import it by using mtcars and check the class of the variable mpg, mile per gallon. It returns a numeric value, indicating a continuous variable.

```{r}
dataset <- mtcars
class(dataset$mpg)
```
## Data Frames
A data frame is a list of vectors which are of equal length. A matrix contains only one type of data, while a data frame accepts different data types (numeric, character, factor, etc.).

(You may remember from the discussion last week about matrices that all the elements that you put in a matrix should be of the same type)

For instance, when doing a market research survey, however, you often have questions such as:

  'Are you married?' or 'yes/no' questions (logical) <br /> 
  'How old are you?' (numeric) <br /> 
  'What is your opinion on this product?' or other 'open-ended' questions   (character)<br /> 
...
The output, namely the respondents' answers to the questions formulated above, is a data set of different data types. You will often find yourself working with data sets that contain different data types instead of only one.

A data frame has the variables of a data set as columns and the observations as rows. This will be a familiar concept for those coming from different statistical software packages such as SAS or SPSS.

Useful Note: the function head() enables you to show the first observations of a data frame. Similarly, the function tail() prints out the last observations in your data set.Both head() and tail() print a top line called the 'header', which contains the names of the different variables in your data set. Another method that is often used to get a rapid overview of your data is the function str(). The function str() shows you the structure of your data set.

data.frame(df, stringsAsFactors = TRUE) <br /> 
arguments:<br /> 
-df: It can be a matrix to convert as a data frame or a collection of variables to join <br /> 
-stringsAsFactors: Convert string to factor by default

```{r}
# Create a, b, c, d variables
a <- c(10,20,30,40)
b <- c('book', 'pen', 'textbook', 'pencil_case')
c <- c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE)
d <- c(2.5, 8, 10, 7)
# Join the variables to create a data frame
df <- data.frame(a,b,c,d)
df
```
http://uc-r.github.io/integer_double/

```{r}
# Name the data frame
names(df) <- c('ID', 'items', 'store', 'price')
df
#print the structure
str(df)
```
By default, data frame returns string variables as a factor.
```{r}
df[1,2] #book
#select column 1 
df[,1]
#select entire columns from 2 rows
df[1:2,]
#select rows 1 to 3 and columns 3 to 4
df[1:3,3:4]
df[,c('ID','store')]
#append a column
pfa<-c(10,35,36,4)
df$new<-pfa
df
df$ID
```
```{r}
#subset(x, condition)

subset (df,subset=price>5)
```
Question: Which items are cheaper than pen?

## PRACTICE
```{r}
# Definition of vectors
name <- c("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune")
type <- c("Terrestrial planet", "Terrestrial planet", "Terrestrial planet", 
          "Terrestrial planet", "Gas giant", "Gas giant", "Gas giant", "Gas giant")
diameter <- c(0.382, 0.949, 1, 0.532, 11.209, 9.449, 4.007, 3.883)
rotation <- c(58.64, -243.02, 1, 1.03, 0.41, 0.43, -0.72, 0.67)
rings <- c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)
